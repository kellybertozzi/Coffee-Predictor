# Coffee Preference Predictor ☕️

An in-progress machine learning project that explores predicting coffee type and flavor preferences based on user-defined taste inputs.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and experimenting with a feed-forward neural network that predicts coffee preferences using features such as:
- Temperature preference
- Sweetness level
- Creaminess
- Flavor notes

The goal is to explore the end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- (Optional / as applicable: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar)

## Current Features
- Feature encoding and data preprocessing pipelines
- Initial feed-forward neural network architecture
- Model training and evaluation experiments
- Iterative testing of different architectures and performance metrics

## Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with neural network design
- Practice feature engineering and preprocessing techniques
- Understand model evaluation and iterative improvement
- Apply machine learning concepts to a real-world, preference-based problem

## Project Status
🚧 **In Progress**  
This project is actively being developed and refined. Model performance and architecture are still being explored.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset and input feature space
- Tune hyperparameters for improved performance
- Experiment with alternative model architectures
- Improve prediction interpretability

## Motivation
As someone interested in both machine learning and everyday user-facing applications, I chose coffee preferences as a fun and practical domain to apply ML concepts.
